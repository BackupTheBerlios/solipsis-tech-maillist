Well the project has been dead for years, and the aforementioned example
is probably obsolete anyway... I suggest your post on the twisted-python
mailing-list asking people for their (up-to-date :-)) solutions.

Regards

Antoine.

There's been a renewed effort of Solipsis (http://www.solipsis.org/) also from France Telecom's R&D branch Orange Lab. You might also want to check out with them on updates of the project.

Cheers,

Shun-Yun

Hello Antoine,

thanks for your reply, actually, I was referred to that link by someone 
in the Twiste3d mailing list, it seams to be the best way to do it if 
you want it to work on all platforms.

Regards,
Gabriel
